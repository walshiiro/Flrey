**Warning: This project is not finished, and I am not hosting this bot atm. I just want to create this for educational purposes.**

This is the mostly-complete repo for the Flrey Discord Genshin bot which you can invite [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1239763299491381359). 
# Set the user!

Firstly, to view your basic user page, please use `^user` if you already linked your account or `^checkuser "your uid"` if you didn't link your account.
